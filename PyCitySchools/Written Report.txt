First Conclusion

                    Average Math Score  Average Reading Score  % Passing Math  % Passing Reading  % Overall Passing
School Size                                                                                                        
Small (<1000)                83.821598              83.929843       93.550225          96.099437          89.883853
Medium (1000-2000)           83.374684              83.864438       93.599695          96.790680          90.621535
Large (2000-5000)            77.746417              81.344493       69.963361          82.766634          58.286003

Based on the table above: Schools with larger size have a lower overall passing %. This could be due to having larger class sizes which means there are no capacity to focus on all student adequately.
Small sized schools and medium size schools have similar overall passing %.
